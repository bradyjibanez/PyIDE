**Installation**
************

In order to install and configure as contributor/coordinator node, ensure the following prerequsites:

1) Anaconda V > 5.0
2) Cloned local source of repository

...and that's that.

The purpose of this implementation is to allow for the least dependant replication requirement. The conda environment contains
heirarchical file orientation and package requirements, and allows for overriding entirely local processed configuration. Simply delete the conda env to rid the installation and all requirements entirely.
